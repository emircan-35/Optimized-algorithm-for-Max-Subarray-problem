# Optimized-algorithm-for-Max-Subarray-problem

There are many common algorithms for the maximum sub array problem. This work was developed on two algoritm, first one is named brute force and the second one is named divide and conquer.

The brute force algorithm working as O(nÂ²) is commonly used for low size inputs. The other one, divide and conquer working as O(n.lgn) is mostly used for large size inputs.

Firstly, both algoritms is implemented in java environment. Then, a measurement is completed on fully randomly created arrays. After measurements, the optimized point, which divide
and conquer algoritmh starts to be faster is determined. After determining the optimized point, another measurement for testing is completed.

According to the results, optimized algoritm has a huge difference other than two algorithm. 

All the process determined above can be done again by running the program. If one wants to see the results, it is enough to run the program after cloning the source code.

Two text file is created to save the results of every measurements, also for checking whether the program is working properly. 

! ATTENTION !
The program was made without taking some basic courses such as data structures, algorithm analysis etc. So, it should be considered as a learning activity.
