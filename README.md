# Optimized-algorithm-for-Max-Subarray-problem

There are many common algorithms for the maximum subarray problem. This work was developed on two algorithms, the first one is named brute force and the second one is named divide and conquer.

The brute force algorithm working as O(nÂ²) is commonly used for low-size inputs. The other one, divide and conquer working as O(n.lgn) is mostly used for large size inputs.

Firstly, both algorithms are implemented in the java environment. Then, a measurement is completed on fully randomly created arrays. After measurements, the optimized point, which the divide
and conquer algorithm starts to be faster is determined. After determining the optimized point, another measurement for testing is completed.

According to the results, the optimized algorithm has a huge difference other than the two algorithms. 

All the processes determined above can be done again by running the program. It is enough to run the program after cloning the source code if one wants to see the results.

Two text files are created to save the results of every measurement and check whether the program is working properly. 

! ATTENTION!
The program was made without taking some basic courses such as data structures, algorithm analysis, etc. So, it should be considered as a learning activity.
